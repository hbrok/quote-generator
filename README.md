# Quote Generator

This is my entry for the [10k Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/) challenge.

It generates a random quote using a random font with a random accessible color scheme. It's especially neat when you refresh and get a perfect quote/color/font combination!

- Quotes from [http://forismatic.com/](http://forismatic.com/)
- Colors from [davidgorges/color-contrast](https://github.com/davidgorges/color-contrast-php) & [mistic100/randomcolor](https://github.com/mistic100/RandomColor.php)
- Fonts from [https://fonts.google.com/](https://fonts.google.com/)
